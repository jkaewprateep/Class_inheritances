# Class_inheritances
Implement Python class inheritance with Pygames and AI for agent queue learning, 🐑💬 ➰ This is preparation for multi-agent queue learning and cascade machine learning algorithms. This note has inspiration from the course Python 3 Programming Specialization [ Link ]( https://coursera.org/share/ba047d1c5738f9bba3b08a5ac883569d ) about the Python class inheritance and communications.

### 🧸💬 Sample screen monitoring from Agent Queue class.

🐑💬 ➰ There are class variables and definition variables in the class present of use or group by ```self``` and ```group``` for communication between definition methods, internal class, parent and child classes, and internal class usage depending on variable types and configurations. </br>
👧💬 🎈 Internal class variable defined at the class level and access of this class variable required interaction with ```user``` and ```group``` by ```method``` or ```references```. There is no reference now to create an instance of a class with ```<objectId>``` and access to the same values they used in Python because Python is translation code programming </br>
🐑💬 ➰ I remembered you can create of a new instance with the same ```<objectId>``` in C that someone is called modern memory hacks but it is now not compatible because of the variable memory assignment method. A programmer who are working with C or programming level knows that ```<objectId>``` is only reference and you can create of a fake message request with the same ```<objectId>``` in communication and now stageless communication prevents them from reuse of the ```<object variables>```. You can create APIs and remove of create messages and required communication methods to prevent third-party applications from reusing the same message but they can do it by communication networks level anyway. </br>

### 🧸💬 Library import.

🐑💬 ➰ Refer to class or directory structure by the import reference commands, we have control of changes of class method files in the library by ```summation value``` and ```external library```. </br>
🦭💬 ```Complied``` codes or ```backup``` running code is a good method when ```separation of execution path``` from method and data are good practice for working with third-party applications or someone calls sensitive data. </br>
🐐💬 In design the Pygame environment constant is similar to console games players and communication of controller and games player device controller accepted of both ```decimal numeric values``` and ```heximal numeric values``` when some games player modification can use ```binary numeric values``` communications but the communication types is start from initial message. Do not shift the jumper otherwise, you may return to ```A-B``` mode as default. ( It is the controller at last button A and B is working or most contrast control is working - can explain in electronics communication and neurons sciences ) </br>

👧💬 🎈 ```Pluse code modulation``` or ```time-shifted channel``` was developed by Nintendo and distributed during our youth time, long years after supporting of the government they launched the games players ```Nintendo PlayStation``` . </br>
🐑💬 ➰ This may be the event called ```time capsules ``` because of the ability to recover communication messages and transfer rates vary by device negotiation compatibilities. In the ```time capsules``` can store validation matrixes and summary values of the designed communication channel's message you can categorize and summarize computer players for their actions responses and feedback as in console games players save CPU time process when the console box use compatibilities specification for decrypted communication message and response. Of course, random variances create a of variety actions and possibilities by the actions played. </br>

### 🧸💬 Global project variables.

🧸💬 We like to create constructs to manage variables and transform value, looking into micro-controller devices and PLC application programming we would like to define the response variables and interfaces before constructing a method for communication because of the same behavior inherited from Nintendo. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ The number of frames is only a number it does not require a large value since the communication is still online and happens. </br>

nb_frames = 100000000000
```

### 🧸💬 Create a learning environment.

🐨🎁🎵🎶 In a learning environment is an application with the construct of possible variables they are setup sample the Half-life games for modern environment simulation games and modification games are defined construct variables from the learning environment application games. They are also called ```learning environments``` . 👤🗯️ ```ไปเรียนแม่‼️```

### 🧸💬 Snake player class implementation

🐐💬 First we need to know the favorites expectation method ```___init___``` and ```___call___``` we defined ```___init___``` for initialize class variables and setup class running environment when creating the class and initial. In some programs, you can create a Python class without initial as you ```copy``` . </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Some applications ```seeker``` find the ```invoker``` step to by pass for application validation, the ```__call___``` definition function and ```___init___``` definition function is created into difference place and working continuously as a sequence. Once a ```seeker``` can access the class method initialization and guess of the ```next method in rows``` and ```multiplication variables``` but they cannot skip of the ```___call___``` definition method without modify the games function. </br>
🐐💬 I can randomly place the same variable name somewhere and forget, the ```seeker``` can invoke of the target function by the ```function invoker``` but they cannot modify the values since they are the same variable names. </br>
👧💬 🎈 The games cheaters do not have class they do not know how to types ```self``` 💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 🛍️👠💄 . </br>
